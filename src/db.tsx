        Title: "Wii Anubis II (USA) in 02:17.48 by CoolKirby.",
  
        Description: `<em>Anubis II</em> (read: "Anubis, the Second") is a fast-paced
              platformer by Data Design Interactive, the creators of the
              infamous <em>Ninjabread Man</em>. The evil spirit Mumm'hotep has
              plunged Egypt into darkness, and Anubis II, the guardian of the
              tombs, sets out to stop him!
              <p>
                But it seems that this quest is much easier than it appears.
                After completely skipping going through the starting gate,
                Anubis decides to play a bunch of minigames. This somehow
                causes his quest to become completed. There was much
                rejoicing.
              </p>`,

        Title:
          'Wii GoldenEye: 007 (USA) "007 Classic difficulty" in 1:41:35.67 by FitterSpace.',
        Description: `<em>Goldeneye: 007</em> for the Nintendo Wii is a full-scale re-imagining of the N64 game, and includes no assets from the original game. It takes the classic Goldeneye story and updates it to the standards of a modern first-person shooter. It also features Daniel Craig rather than Pierce Brosnan, who played James Bond in the film and the Nintendo 64 game. It has many modern features such as the ability to sprint and aim down sights.
              <p>The missions in this game are based on the ones from the classic Nintendo 64 version instead of the film. Some of the stages from the original game have been combined in this game (for example, Bunker on Wii is like Bunker+Silo on N64 and Cradle is like Control+Cradle on N64). But there are also some brand-new missions like Nightclub and Solar.
              </p><p>This TAS plays on the hardest difficulty, 007 Classic. Like the original N64 game, the harder difficulties have more objectives than the easier difficulties. This makes the route much more interesting because the goal isn't simply to sprint to the end of the mission. 007 Classic also removes regenerating health, so there is much more health management on this difficulty. Because a modern Call-of-Duty style FPS game with no health regeneration would be unfair, the developers added body armor that is only available on 007 classic, which the TAS makes great use of.
              </p><p>Since this game has roughly 35 minutes of unskippable cutscenes, the author provided a <a class="extlink" rel="nofollow" id="i3709A14C_1" href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAHJw0kh6Gg">condensed video</a> with all the cutscenes and loading screens removed.
